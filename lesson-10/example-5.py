'''
Let's practice updating values from dictionaries.

We use the same [] approach that we used when updating values. 

If a key we try to update doesn't exist, it adds it to the dictionary.

dict = {}
dict[new_key] = new_value

print(dict) --> {new_key:new_value}

# Welcome Back to StockY
# There are many new released sneakers we need to 
# add to our inventory. 

inventory = {
    'Jordan 1' : 1,
    'Yeezy'    : 8,
    'Air Max'  : 10,
    'SB Dunk'  : 5,
	'Cortez'   : 20,
	'Jordan 6' : 100 
}

# TODO: 
# 1. Go to https://www.kicksonfire.com/app/
# 2. Pick 3 sneakers we should sell at our shop
# 3. Add 10 pairs of each to our inventory dictionary.
inventory['Birkenstocks'] = 10
inventory['Hoka One One'] = 10
inventory['Vans'] = 10
print(inventory)
