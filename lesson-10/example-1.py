Let's practice creating a dictionary!

Dicitonaries are a collection of key:value pairs.

dict_name = {key:value, key:value, key:value}

# You own an empanada shop and want to store the price 
# of each type (flavor) of empanada. 

# TODO: Convert the two lists below into a dictionary 
# called menu, where the key is the flavor and the value 
# is the price (as an float)

flavors = ["chicken", "beef", "cheese", "guava"]
prices = [1.99, 1.99, 1.00, 2.50]

menu = dict(zip(flavors, prices))
print(menu)
