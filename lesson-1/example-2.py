# Challenge: Solve the problems below and test the code in your terminal
# You'll be adding a new line of code at each step. 

# 1. Create a variable named age and assign your age as the value
age = 27

# 2. Run this file in the terminal what do you see? 
# Don't see anything because we haven't printed this value, just declared and assigned it.

# Use print to display the value type: print(age)
print(age)

# 3. Let's make another variable called height and assign it the value of 50
height = 50

# 4. Now let's type this line:
# age = height now print the value of age again
age = height
print(age)

# 5. Save and run this file again. What do you see in the terminal?
# See the value '50' printed to the screen, since we reassigned age to equal the value of height.

# For long comments you can use """ and """
